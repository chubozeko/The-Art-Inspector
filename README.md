# The Art Inspector
An art inspector is tasked to identify and organize real art pieces from the fake ones by using a special magnifying glass which can view authentic signatures from the artist. This project covers the topics of render textures, translations, rotations using quaternions, and grabbing objects in VR. This was the second homework assignment for the Introduction to XR Systems course (521293A).

## Instructions
- You are tasked to identify which of these paintings are Authentic.
- Each Authentic painting has a hidden Signature from its Artist.
- These Signature can only be seen using the Magnifier.

## Tools used
- Unity
- Visual Studio Community 2019
- C#
- Meta Quest 2 HMD + controllers

## Controls
For Meta Quest 2:
- **Left** or **Right Grip** = *Grab*
- **Left Trigger** = *Left Painting is "Authentic"*
- **Right Trigger** = *Right Painting is "Authentic"*
- **X** = *Start Game*
- **A** = *Go to Next Paintings*
- **B** = *Proceed to Level 2*
- **Y** = *Quit Game*

### Extra Information for Level 2:
Make sure you have enough space around you to grab the objects on the ground, as they might fall and disperse farther than your VR workspace boundary.
